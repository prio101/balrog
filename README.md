# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

- Install Docker
- Run docker compose build
- Run docker compose up
- Run docker compose run web bash in separate terminal.
   - Run rails db:create in that separate terminal.
